# TFT_ILI93XX
Fast library for displays ILI9340,41,42,44 for Teensy's,Arduino's,ESP826,SPARK (maybe) and more to come.<br>
Based on my TFT_ILI9163C, shares the same commands, functionalities, fonts, icon and examples.<br>
It's fast! Much faster than Adafruit, more fexible and featured, it uses my proprietary LGPO Rendering engine for fonts and icons.
