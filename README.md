# TFT_ILI93XX
Fast library for displays ILI9340,41,42,44 for Teensy's,Arduino's,ESP826,SPARK (maybe) and more to come.<br>
Based on my TFT_ILI9163C, shares the same commands, functionalities, fonts, icon and examples.<br>
It's fast! Much faster than Adafruit, more fexible and featured, it uses my proprietary LGPO Rendering engine for fonts and icons.<br>
<b>In short:</b><br>

 - Fast!
 - Uses compatible hardware SPI (that can be shared with other devices)
 - Uses single display file so it's easy add more display's
 - Works with many MCU's (Teensy's, Arduino's 8bit, DUE, ESP8266 for now)
 - Full featured, all basic primitives plus more commands for easy programming
 - Uses LGPO Rendering for Fonts and Icons
 - It uses version 2.4 sumotoy font format shared with the other libraries here
 - Full SPI Transaction (where applicable) compatible
 - Can use alternate SPI pins (where applicable)
 - User can convert his fonts/icons trough LCD Font Converter app by riuson (Vladimir)
